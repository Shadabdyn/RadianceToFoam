This series of utilities helps to perform the following tasks. 

1. Export OpenFOAM patches as STL 
2. Calculate radiation in Radiance 
3. Convert the output into OpenFOAM consistent input format 
4. Run CFD simulations with solar shading information 

**** The utility is experimental and crashes can be expected *****
